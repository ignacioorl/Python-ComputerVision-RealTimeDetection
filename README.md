# Python-ComputerVision-RealTimeDetection

Using a dataset of vehicles and persons from Roboflow Universe (https://universe.roboflow.com/shruthi-b-w7llf/21-4-22), a real time detection model was built based on YOLOv8. You can find attached a final sample of how did it work. Taking into consideration the short time for training, the results are satisfactory, altough clearly improvable.

All the pre-processing steps and augmentations were done using Roboflow. In addition, due to resource limitations, all this steps were done only for a part of the entire dataset, probably affecting the final algorithm performance.
